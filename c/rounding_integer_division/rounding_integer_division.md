--------------------------

## TLDR: Here's a macro; use it!
    
    // To do (numer/denom), rounded to the nearest whole integer, use:
    #define ROUND_DIVIDE(numer, denom) (((numer) + (denom) / 2) / (denom))

Usage example:

    int num = ROUND_DIVIDE(13,7); // 13/7 = 1.857 --> rounds to 2, so num is 2

## Full answer:

Some of these answers are crazy looking! Codeface nailed it though! (See @0xC0DEFACE's [answer here][1]). I really like the type-free macro or gcc statement expression form over the function form, however, so, I wrote this answer with a detailed explanation of what I'm doing (ie: why this mathematically works) and put it into 2 forms:

## 1. Macro form, with detailed commentary to explain the whole thing:

    /// @brief      ROUND_DIVIDE(numerator/denominator): round to the nearest whole integer when doing 
    ///             *integer* division only
    /// @details    This works on *integers only* since it assumes integer truncation will take place automatically
    ///             during the division! 
    /// @notes      The concept is this: add 1/2 to any number to get it to round to the nearest whole integer
    ///             after integer trunction.
    ///             Examples:  2.74 + 0.5 = 3.24 --> 3 when truncated
    ///                        2.99 + 0.5 = 3.49 --> 3 when truncated
    ///                        2.50 + 0.5 = 3.00 --> 3 when truncated
    ///                        2.49 + 0.5 = 2.99 --> 2 when truncated
    ///                        2.00 + 0.5 = 2.50 --> 2 when truncated
    ///                        1.75 + 0.5 = 2.25 --> 2 when truncated
    ///             To add 1/2 in integer terms, you must do it *before* the division. This is achieved by 
    ///             adding 1/2*denominator, which is (denominator/2), to the numerator before the division.
    ///             ie: `rounded_division = (numer + denom/2)/denom`.
    ///             ==Proof==: 1/2 is the same as (denom/2)/denom. Therefore, (numer/denom) + 1/2 becomes 
    ///             (numer/denom) + (denom/2)/denom. They have a common denominator, so combine terms and you get:
    ///             (numer + denom/2)/denom, which is the answer above.
    /// @param[in]  numerator   any integer type numerator; ex: uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, etc
    /// @param[in]  denominator any integer type denominator; ex: uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, etc
    /// @return     The result of the (numerator/denominator) division rounded to the nearest *whole integer*!
    #define ROUND_DIVIDE(numerator, denominator) (((numerator) + (denominator) / 2) / (denominator))

## 2. [GCC Statement Expression][2] form:
*See [a little more on gcc statement expressions here][3].*

    /// @brief      *gcc statement expression* form of the above macro
    #define ROUND_DIVIDE2(numerator, denominator)               \
    ({                                                          \
        __typeof__ (numerator) numerator_ = (numerator);        \
        __typeof__ (denominator) denominator_ = (denominator);  \
        numerator_ + (denominator_ / 2) / denominator_;         \
    })

## 3. C++ Function Template form:
(Added Mar./Apr. 2020)

    #include <limits>

    // Template form for C++ (with type checking to ensure only integer types are passed in!)
    template <typename T>
    T round_division(T numerator, T denominator)
    {
        // Ensure only integer types are passed in, as this round division technique does NOT work on
        // floating point types since it assumes integer truncation will take place automatically
        // during the division!
        // - The following static assert allows all integer types, including their various `const`,
        //   `volatile`, and `const volatile` variations, but prohibits any floating point type
        //   such as `float`, `double`, and `long double`. 
        // - Reference page: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/is_integer
        static_assert(std::numeric_limits<T>::is_integer, "Only integer types are allowed"); 
        return (numerator + denominator/2)/denominator;
    }

todo: test this for negative inputs & update this answer if it works: 

```
#define ROUND_DIVIDE(numer, denom) ((numer < 0) != (denom < 0) ? ((numer) - (denom) / 2) / (denom) : ((numer) + (denom) / 2) / (denom))
```
