Test the libcurl example "http-post.c". See references below for links to it.

STATUS: (status)

To compile and run (assuming you've already `cd`ed into this dir):
```bash
# NB: you may need to use `-std=gnu++17` instead of `-std=c++17` in order to obtain extra GNU
# gcc features, including gcc extensions, POSIX cmds, and Linux sytem cmds.
# See: [my answer]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71801111/4561887

# FIRST, follow the curl installation & setup instructions here: "eRCaGuy_hello_world/cpp/README.md"
# THEN, build & run it like this:
# In C:
time ( \
    time gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c17 \
    curl_examples__http-post.c \
    -lcurl \
    -o bin/a \
    && time bin/a \
)
```
