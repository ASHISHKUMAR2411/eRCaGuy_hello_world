A simple Linux C++ system call library to allow you to easily make system calls and read back the
response through a pipe.

TODO:
1.

STATUS: wip

To compile and run:
- See a file which includes this header file, as an example.

References:
1. System call and pipe examples:
   1. *****+ "eRCaGuy_hello_world/c/read_system_call_via_pipe__keypress.c"
   1. ***** "eRCaGuy_hello_world/c/read_system_call_via_pipe__arrow_keypresses.c" - example of
      using a pipe with `popen()` to read back the response from a system call in C or C++
