  # Positions
  - name: x
    description: x position
    units: mm
    type: int64_t
    value: 100
  - name: y
    description: y position
    units: mm
    type: int64_t
    value: 200
  - name: z
    description: z position
    units: mm
    type: int64_t
    value: 300

  # Velocities
  - name: u
    description: velocity in the x direction
    units: mm/s
    type: int64_t
    value: 10
  - name: v
    description: velocity in the y direction
    units: mm/s
    type: int64_t
    value: 11
  - name: w
    description: velocity in the z direction
    units: mm/s
    type: int64_t

  # Euler Angles
  - &phi_anchor
    name: phi
    description: roll angle
    units: deg
    type: double
    value: 0.10
  - name: theta
    description: pitch angle
    units: deg
    type: double
    value: -0.20
  - name: psi
    description: yaw angle (heading)
    units: deg
    type: double
    value: 45.1234

  # Practice referencing an anchor via an alias
  - *phi_anchor

  # Same as above, but override `description` and `value`
  # See: https://yaml.org/type/merge.html
  # Doesn't seem to work as expected, so comment it out! I'm not sure if it's my syntax that's a
  # problem, or a bug in the yaml-cpp library, but I think it's a bug in the library. Note: the
  # parser does read this in without throwing an error. It just doesn't represent or print this last
  # node in the sequence (list) correctly is all.
  # - # Override
  #   <<: *phi_anchor
  #   description: roll angle yeah!
  #   value: 0.1020304
