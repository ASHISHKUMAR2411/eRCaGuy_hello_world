Learn how to construct `std::experimental::filesystem::path::path`s.

STATUS: (status)

To compile and run (assuming you've already `cd`ed into this dir):
```bash
# NB: you may need to use `-std=gnu++17` instead of `-std=c++17` in order to obtain extra GNU
# gcc features, including gcc extensions, POSIX cmds, and Linux sytem cmds.
# See: [my answer]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71801111/4561887

# 1. In C++
time g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c++17 std_experimental_filesystem_path__demo.cpp -o bin/a -lstdc++fs && bin/a
```

IMPORTANT: if you see this linker error:
    ```
    /tmp/ccfHRXrJ.o: In function `main':
    std_experimental_filesystem_path__demo.cpp:(.text.startup+0x9c): undefined reference to `std::experimental::filesystem::v1::__cxx11::path::_M_split_cmpts()'
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    ```
...it's because you forgot to link to the library with `-lstdc++fs` above! Add that to your build
   flags! See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/33159746/4561887
