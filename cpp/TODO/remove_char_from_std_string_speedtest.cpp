TODO: I still need to speed test and speed profile these ways to see which is fastest!

C++ Remove new line from multiline string: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71565411/4561887
- see my notes at the bottom of this, my answer:

> Whats the most efficient way of removing a 'newline' from a `std::string`?

As far as the _most efficient_ way goes--that I'd have to speed test/profile and see. I'll see if I
can get back to you on that and run some speed tests between the top two answers here, and a
C-style way like I did here: [Removing elements from array in C]
(https://stackoverflow.com/a/70043744/4561887). I'll use [my `nanos()` timestamp function][2] for
speed testing.
