Write some basic functions to do REST API POST and GET calls using libcurl in C.

Note: using a manual, static response buffer in C (see `buffer_t` below) was a pain in the butt!
BUT, it _is_ real-time and safe for safety-critical systems! If using C++ in the future, on NON
real-time and NON safety-critical systems in the future, use a `std::string` (or `std::vector` if
using `uint8_t` types) as that would allow automatic dynamic memory allocation and growth
under-the-hood and be **much** easier to implement! Anyway though, what I have done here is correct
and works well, albeit it took a little extra effort.

Example command-line alternatives to this C program:

    # GET

    curl "https://example.com"
    # OR_ (same thing):
    curl -X GET "https://example.com"

    # POST

    curl --data "moo mooo moo moo" -X POST "https://example.com"

From `man curl`:

       -d, --data <data>
              (HTTP)  Sends  the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same
              way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit
              button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server  using  the  con‚Äê
              tent-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

STATUS: wip

To compile and run (assuming you've already `cd`ed into this dir):
```bash
# NB: you may need to use `-std=gnu++17` instead of `-std=c++17` in order to obtain extra GNU
# gcc features, including gcc extensions, POSIX cmds, and Linux sytem cmds.
# See: [my answer]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71801111/4561887

# FIRST, follow the curl installation & setup instructions here: "eRCaGuy_hello_world/cpp/README.md"
# THEN, build & run it like this: <=========
# In C:
time ( \
    time gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c17 \
    curl_rest_api_http_post_and_get.c \
    -lcurl \
    -o bin/a \
) && time bin/a

# Note, to run the "simple GET" example (instead of this code), do the following.
# Here is that example: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/simple.html
time ( \
    time gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O3 -std=c17 \
    curl/docs/examples/simple.c \
    -lcurl \
    -o bin/a \
) && time bin/a
```
