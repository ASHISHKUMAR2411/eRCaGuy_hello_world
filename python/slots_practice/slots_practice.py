GOAL:

Learn a little bit about the special Python `__slots__` list, class variables vs. instance
variables, private variables vs public variables, and internal Python variables surrounded by double
underscores (`__some_var__`). Also practice passing and using list args to a function (ex: as
`*args`), and keyword key:value dict args to a function as well (ex: as `**kwargs`).

PYTHON DEFINITIONS:

1. Variables prefixed with a single underscore (`_`) are user-specific **private variables**.
All other variables (NOT beginning with `_`) are therefore, by default, **public variables**.
Ex:
    ```
    _my_private_var = 123
    # vs:
    my_public_var = 123
    ```

1. Variables which begin and end with two underscores (`__some_name__`) are **internal Python
variables** used by the Python interpreter/language. Ex: `__slots__`, `__name__`, `__main__`.

1. Variables outside of all methods inside a class are **class variables**. They are shared among
all objects (instances) of a given class. You can access them inside the class definition in 2 ways:
    ```
    MyClass.class_var
    self.class_var
    ```
  ...and outside the class definition directly as well, so long as they are public, NOT private
  variables. Ex:
    ```
    myClass = MyClass()
    myClass.class_var
    ```

1. Variables inside any class method and which are prefixed with `self.` are **instance variables**.
They have unique values for each instance of a class. For classes which do NOT use the `__slots__`
internal variable shown below, these "instance variables" are stored via a key:value dict, with each
key being the name of the variable (stored and accessed as a _string_). When you use the special
`__slots__` variable manually, however, you can save run-time RAM by having Python store these
instance variable names in a list instead of in a dict!
