Demonstrate how to do basic bytes manipulation and conversion to human-readable strings in Python.
In C and C++, this is common-place for me, and is my "bread and butter". In Python, it's like magic
sauce. I need to document it so I don't forget how it works.

To run this script:
    ./raw_bytes_practice.py
    # OR
    python3 raw_bytes_practice.py
