# sandbox

These files are not ready to be used in demos; they are hacky, incomplete, whatever. This is my "sandbox" for playing around and running quick tests which are either wrong, not runnable, not properly documented, or otherwise in a state making them not "demo ready".

I may not know how these things work myself and I am trying to figure it out. Certainly I can't teach others something I don't yet understand myself.
